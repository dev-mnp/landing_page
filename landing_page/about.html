                <p>
                    Makkal Nalapani is a large scale people welfare initiative organised as part of
                    Amma’s Birthday celebrations. The initiative is intended to support individuals
                    and families by addressing genuine needs through a structured and transparent
                    process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The programme focuses on organised planning, coordination across districts,
                    and responsible execution so that support reaches the right beneficiaries in
                    a dignified and accountable manner.
                </p>

                <h2>Purpose of the Initiative</h2>

                <p>
                    The primary purpose of Makkal Nalapani is to identify authentic requirements
                    from the public and provide timely assistance. Emphasis is placed on fairness,
                    verification, and proper utilisation of resources rather than ad hoc distribution.
                </p>

                <h2>How the Initiative is Organised</h2>

                <p>
                    The initiative follows a phased approach carried out over several weeks. The
                    broad flow includes:
                </p>

                    <li>Verification and shortlisting of beneficiaries</li>

                    <li>Planned distribution during the main event</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

                <h2>Commitment and Accountability</h2>

                <p>
                    The initiative is carried out with strong emphasis on documentation,
                    accountability, and transparency. Each stage is designed to minimise errors,
                    avoid duplication, and maintain trust among participants and beneficiaries.
